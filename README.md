## Background

<p>Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
</p>
<p> To help process this data, we create machine learning model (SVM) capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.</P>
